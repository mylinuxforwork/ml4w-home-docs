You can easily install Dotfiles configurations by downloading the url to a `.dotinst` file and following the app's instructions.

The Dotfiles Installer automatically creates a backup of the existing configuration for you. In addition, the app can protect your personal customizations so that they are not overwritten during an update.

## Dotfiles Installer Folders

Dotfiles will be stored in the `.mydotfiles` folder within your `home` directory. You can change the folder in preferences.
