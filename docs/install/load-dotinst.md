Copy the url to the `.dotinst` file and click on Load. The Dotfiles Installer will read the configuration and show up information about the Dotfiles. Based on that, you can decide if you want to proceed or cancel the setup.

## Run the Setup Script

Dotfiles developers can include a setup script to install all dependencies for the dotfiles before installing them. If such a script is available, the Dotfiles Installer will asked how to proceed.

If the setup script doesn't support your distro, you can install all dependencies manually and skip the execution of the setup script.
